This is an Anki package geared to reduce as many visual distractions and help you focus on the content.

It makes use of the following plugins:
- Custom Background Image and Gear Icon (to style CSS)
- Edit Field During Review Cloze
- Fill the blanks - Multiple typecloze support
- PassFail 2 Remove the Easy and Hard Buttons
- Review Heatmap

It also includes the following **card types**:

1. `qa Question Answer`
> Question and Answer (Q&A) type cards.

2. `Cloze Programming`
> Fill-in-blanks type cards for learning programming concepts and syntax.

3. `Enhanced Cloze Cards`
> Same as Cloze, but but with a Subject and Title field to help organise your cards.

4. `Basic Enhanced`
> Same as Basic, but with a Subject and Title field to help organise your cards.
Think of them as Sticky Notes to help you memorise small bits of info.

These first three card types are designed to force you to actively recall information, while the last one is meant to help you passively recall for difficult concepts that you don't entirely understand.

All card presentation are thoughtfully designed for its content.
