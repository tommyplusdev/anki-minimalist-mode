# anki-minimalist-mode
thoughtfully designed minimalist theme, cards and curated plugins for anki

![anki_minimalist_theme_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116316499/213336733-5bc952da-fb9e-4075-8e73-bb08a5603c92.png)

This Anki package helps you focus on the content by simplifying the UI, improving touch accessibility, and adding features that enhance your overall experience.

Most importantly, it gives you easy templates that simplify your Anki card creation and presents them in a clear, focused way.

## About
It makes use of the following plugins:
- Custom Background Image and Gear Icon (to style CSS)
- Edit Field During Review Cloze
- Fill the blanks - Multiple typecloze support
- PassFail 2 Remove the Easy and Hard Buttons
- Review Heatmap
- Field AutoComplete 

It also includes the following **card types**:

1. `qa Question Answer`
> Question and Answer (Q&A) type cards.
> 
> Your bread and butter cards. Write exactly one question and answer. This forces you to keep your cards as simple as possible.

2. `Cloze Programming`
> Fill-in-blanks type cards for learning programming concepts, algorithms and syntax.
>
> To use this card effectively, I recommend using this everytime you want to remember writing code. <br> For example, if you keep forgetting to write a certain key word, syntax, etc.
  
  This is also recommended to be used with CodeWars/LeetCode to help you with recalling how you solved a problem.

3. `Cloze Enhanced`
> Same as Cloze, but but with a Subject and Title field to help organise your cards.
> 
> This is an alternative way to write down a flashcard, similar to the Q&A type card. It's a second option in case you can't think of a question, or don't think a question would be a good way for you to recall something.

4. `Basic Enhanced`
> Same as Basic, but with a Subject and Title field to help organise your cards.
>
> It's a passive recall card. This is the least efficient out of the three, but has its place because it's a flexible card. 
> Think of them as Sticky Notes to help you memorise small bits of info.

These first three card types are designed to force you to actively recall information, while the last one is meant to help you passively recall for difficult concepts that you don't entirely understand.

All card presentation are carefully designed for its content, be it a mix of images, text and code.

## Requirements
- Windows / Mac / Linux version of Anki
- `night-mode` or Dark Mode is enabled in your Anki preferences.
> This is a dark-mode only theme.
- Anki >= 2.1.55

For other devices that use Anki: if this is popular enough, I may look into developing a similar theme for AnkiDroid/Anki iPhone.

## How To Install

1. After downloading the source files (or `git clone`), open the .apkg file. This will give you a new deck called 'test', which contains the four new card types: `qa Question Answer`, `Cloze Programming`, `Cloze Enhanced`, `Basic Enhanced`.

2. Download The Plugins from Anki: Open up Anki, then press <kbd>CMD + A</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL + A</kbd> to open up the Add-ons Menu, then click "Get Add-ons" and copy paste these codes in to install them from the Anki website directly.

```

3. In the same Add-on Menu, click View Files. This brings you to the general Anki Plugin Folder. <br>
Drag and Drop the the plugin folder (`1210908941`) into your Anki Plugins folder & overwrite the CSS files. 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è As with anything data-related, be sure to make a backup of your entire Anki Plugins folder.

4. Open Anki Preferences and change the UI Scaling to what you prefer. I recommend having a scaling of `135%`.

* Optionally: Install the Fonts from the Font folder!

Done ‚úÖ

## I have a bunch of Old Cards that don't follow this format!
Good news, the new cards are **Backwards Compatible!**

If you've been using "Basic Type" cards or "Cloze Type" this whole time, they will work when you convert them to the newer versions.

> (Old Type -> New Type)
>
> Basic -> `Basic Enhanced`
>
> Basic -> `qa Question Answer` (if you made your Front and Back sides a question and answer).
>
> Cloze -> `Cloze Enhanced`

Here's how to do it:

As usual, test out on one card to see which style fits best for your current content.

Tip: To select multiple cards, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>, click a card, and another card, then all cards from the original to the last selected will be selected like so:

## Syntax Rules
While in the Card Editor, here's three basic things to know:

- Italics <kbd>CMD + I</kbd> are used for in-line code, which is the <mark>white highlight</mark> on code. It has monospace font to visually represent it.
- Bold <kbd>CMD + B</kbd> is used for anything you want to point out. This is the green, thicker font you see.
- Underline <kbd>CMD + U</kbd> is the same as Bold. You're free to choose between both of these to point out important content.

üñ•Ô∏è Windows Users: Replace <kbd>CMD</kbd> with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>

### This HTML is syntactically incorrect!
I know, but, this makes use of the default Anki formatting hotkeys to make your life easier.

## What do the Plugins do?
- Custom Background Image and Gear Icon
> Styles the CSS of Anki UI elements.
- Edit Field During Review Cloze
> Lets you edit on the fly, while a card review is open.
- Fill the blanks - Multiple typecloze support
> Enables you to do `Cloze Programming` cards.
- PassFail 2 Remove the Easy and Hard Buttons
> Leaves you with 2 buttons to press, rather than 4. This doesn't mess up the Space Recall Algorithm.
- Review Heatmap
> Like GitHub's code heatmap, a quick glance to see how you're doing. I intentionally hid the details, because it's not necessary to be hooked up on your stat progress. Just keep doing what you're doing per day-- and when you want to reveal it, you can modify the `.heatmap` class and comment out `display: none;` in the CSS file.
- Field AutoComplete 
> This is useful for auto-completing certain fields, especially the subject area, to rapidly make cards.

## I just want the UI and follow my own card templates.
No problem! You'll just need the first add-on, `Custom Background Image and Gear Icon`.

To make sure your Cards have the _same_ background color as the UI, please edit your Card, and visit the CSS section:

Enter in `background: #121212 !important` so it will override any existing styles from the default Anki style or other plugins you may have.

## Recommended Workflow
Use as many Q&A or Cloze Enhanced cards. Cloze Programming are immensely useful for recalling the patterns and syntax of code.
While making the same subject and titled cards (i.e. Subject: JavaScript, Title: Object-Oriented Programming), you can toggle on the Pin icon so it "sticks" across multiple cards.

While reading programming books and articles, you can make these recall Anki cards as you go, saving you time studying.

Evidently, it can still be hard to make high quality cards even with easy templates. That's why I've decided to include the `Edit Field During Review Cloze` add-on: it's highly likely that after a few recalls and/or a couple days later when you are more comfortable with the topic, you have better ways to phrase or add more to your Anki cards. 

Even if you don't immediately understand your own cards from review, you'll eventually come to understand it through sheer repetition and more exposed input from multiple resources you come across.

Happy Anki'ing!

## Known issue(s):

> There's a random space background that showed up when I installed the add-on.

There is a **new update** that addresses this issue with a `config.json` that auto-configures _that_ add-on, which is `Custom Background Image and Gear Icon`. By default, it does indeed have that background and icons.

But, if for some reason, the `config.json` isn't loaded in, you can disable it manually by visiting the Add-on Configuration, then remove the path to the background and enter in `gears.svg` as the icon pack.
